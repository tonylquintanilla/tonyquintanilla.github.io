add_docstrings.py - Two related tools for module-level docstrings.

(1) The Role:/Domain: tag sweep (L-163, the DEFAULT mode when you just
    run this file). Inserts or refreshes a two-line classification block
    inside a module's EXISTING docstring. Touches nothing else.
(2) The original whole-docstring inserter (--docstrings flag, LEGACY
    mode). Replaces a module's entire docstring from the hand-authored
    DOCSTRINGS dict below. Still useful for a brand-new module that has
    no docstring at all yet.

=====================================================================
HOW TO RUN IT (both modes)
=====================================================================
From VS Code: open this file and click Run. It always starts in PREVIEW
-- nothing is written to any file yet, it only prints what it WOULD do.

If the preview finds no problems, it then asks:

    Write these changes? [y/n]:

Click into the terminal panel, type y and press Enter to actually save
the changes, or press Enter (or type n) to stop without writing
anything -- anything other than y/yes is treated as "don't write," so
a blank answer or a typo can never accidentally write. If the preview
finds PROBLEMS, it will not ask -- fix those first (usually a module
missing from MODULE_TAGS, or a role/domain not in the approved list
below) and run it again.

Advanced, not needed for normal use: `python add_docstrings.py --write`
from a terminal writes immediately, skipping the preview and the
question. The y/n prompt above does the same thing more safely, so
there's normally no reason to use this.

=====================================================================
WHEN TO RUN THE TAG SWEEP (mode 1, the default)
=====================================================================
Run it any time a module's Role:/Domain: tag needs adding or fixing:
  - A new module was added and has no tag yet.
  - An existing tag looks wrong and needs correcting.
For a single module, it's just as easy to type the two lines by hand
directly into that module's own docstring (see placement rule below).
This script earns its keep for BULK changes -- many modules at once --
or when you want the placement rule applied consistently without doing
it by hand every time.

HOW TO ADD OR CHANGE A CLASSIFICATION:
  1. Find (or add) the module's entry in MODULE_TAGS below, keyed by
     its path relative to the repo root (e.g. 'my_module.py' for the
     orrery repo root, or 'gallery/assembler/errors.py' for the
     gallery repo).
  2. Set the value to (role, domain). role must be one of ROLE_VOCAB,
     domain one of DOMAIN_VOCAB (both defined below) -- anything else
     is reported as a PROBLEM and never written, so a typo gets caught
     instead of silently landing in a file.
  3. Run this script as described above.

PLACEMENT RULE the sweep applies: the two-line block goes directly
above the module's 'Module updated:' credit line, blank-line separated.
No credit line, OR more than one (a changelog docstring with several
'Module updated:' entries) -> the block goes at the very end of the
docstring instead, after all of it (decided in chat, July 2026 --
wedging it between two changelog entries read worse than putting it
after the whole history).

IS ROLE_MAP UPDATED AUTOMATICALLY? Not yet, as of this writing (Phase 2,
July 2026). This script only writes tags INTO each module's docstring --
module_atlas.py's ROLE_MAP dictionary is still a separate, hand-maintained
table and does not read these tags yet. Phase 3 of this redesign will
change that: module_atlas.py will read the Role:/Domain: lines straight
out of each module's docstring and build ROLE_MAP from them automatically,
every time it runs. Once that lands, editing a module's docstring (by
hand or with this script) is enough -- ROLE_MAP updates itself the next
time module_atlas.py runs, with no separate dictionary to keep in sync.
This paragraph should be updated once Phase 3 ships.

=====================================================================
LEGACY MODE (--docstrings): adding a docstring to a module with none
=====================================================================
Reads each module name in the DOCSTRINGS dict below, inserts a full
triple-quoted docstring before the first import or code line (or below
any shebang/comment header). Uses Python binary mode to preserve line
endings (CRLF/LF). For a module that already has a docstring, prefer
hand-editing it directly, or use the tag sweep above to add just the
two classification lines -- this legacy mode replaces the WHOLE
docstring.
